```typescript
 type Admin = {
   name: string;
   document: string;
 };

 type Moderator = {
   age: number;
   document: number;
 };

 type User = Admin & Moderator

 const user: User = {
   name: 'alves',
   age: 22,
   document: '1234' // Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'never'.
   // since string & number is equals to never
 };
```
